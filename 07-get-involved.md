# Get Involved

## Join the Movement

GAIA AI is an open, collaborative project that welcomes contributions from individuals and organizations committed to planetary regeneration. This guide outlines various ways to participate in and contribute to the ecosystem.

## Token Launch and Community Access

### GAIA AI Token Launch
The GAIA AI ecosystem will be powered by its native token, providing utility across our regenerative initiatives. To ensure fair distribution and prevent sniping during the token launch, we've implemented a specialized access system through our NFT holders (GaiaChads). The token contract address will first be shared with GaiaChads through our gated Discord channels, followed by a public release shortly after.

### NFT Access System
Our community NFTs are available through Manifold and serve as your gateway to:
- Priority access to the GAIA AI token launch
- Early participation in ecosystem activities
- Community governance opportunities

### How to Participate
